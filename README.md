# Fine_Tuning_for_BH_GW

>Introduction
Gravitational waves, predicted by Albert Einstein in 1916 as a consequence of his general theory of relativity, are invisible 'ripples' in the fabric of space-time. Traveling at the speed of light, these waves squeeze and stretch anything in their path as they pass by. Detectable gravitational waves are mostly created when massive objects move at very high speeds, such as black holes or neutron stars orbiting each other. GW created by two colliding black holes were first detected in 2015 by LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory), an extremely sensitive instrument, and have opened a new window on the universe. 

>Goal
The goal is to detect GW signals from the mergers of binary black holes using a model built to analyze simulated GW time-series data from a network of Earth-based detectors.

>What am I going to do?
Identify signals from simulated gravitational wave measurements from a network of 3 gravitational wave interferometers that contains detector noise or detector noise plus a simulated gravitational wave signal.
